Data Binding
	Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the 
	view changes. This is awesome because it eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about.

Controller
	Controllers are the behavior behind the DOM elements. AngularJS lets you express the behavior in a clean readable form without 
	the usual boilerplate of updating the DOM, registering callbacks or watching model changes.
	
Plain Javascript
	Unlike other frameworks, there is no need to inherit from proprietary types in order to wrap the model in accessors methods. 
	AngularJS models are plain old JavaScript objects. This makes your code easy to test, maintain, reuse, and again free from boilerplate.
